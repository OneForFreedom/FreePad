Entry 2: Lets start! 17/07/25

I made HUGE progress!
I completed the Schematic, 90% of product research and the PCB! I used existing footprints which saved me loads of time! (Like 5 hours of research)
Overall it was very fun but then something bad happened.

Entry 3: I made the Case! 18/07/25

I made the case! it took me two hours but i did it! But then when it came to submissions. i completely forgot about this project.
I didnt assemble it nor did anything else that's meaningful to this. So then I left this alone, in the github world. to flow aimlessly.

Time Taken : 2H

Entry 4: Back to business! 20/07/25

I remembered about this project and decided to finish what i started. I finished the assembly and completed the project. For some reason submitting the project takes really long as I have to load and correcly

After 4 more hours of fixing things and bobs. It's DONE!
